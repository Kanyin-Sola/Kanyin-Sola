Hi there 👋
-----------

I’m **Kanyinsola**, a Cyber Security graduate (Class of 2025) with a growing passion for data and analytics. I enjoy working with data and turning messy information into something clear, useful, and easy to understand.

I’m currently doing a **Data Analytics with AI bootcamp at Code Institute**, where I’m building hands-on skills in data analysis, visualisation, and applying AI concepts to real-world datasets. My cybersecurity background naturally feeds into this, as I’m used to working with logs and system data, spotting patterns, and paying attention to details that could easily be missed.

What draws me to data is understanding how and why things influence each other. I like uncovering the story behind the numbers and turning insights into something meaningful. I hope this is something I can continue to do in career, so I create an impact in my environment with the work I do.

Feel free to have a look around and check out what I’ve been building below 👀
